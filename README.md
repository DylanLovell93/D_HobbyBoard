The difficulties of finding like-minded people who are interested in contributing to a common project and / or potential ideas.

Customers are using apps like Reddit, Meetup, GitHub, and Facebook’s groups function to find groups and collaborate on projects.

Our app solves the problem by allowing users to easily search for projects that they would like working on by name, tag, role, or their already existing projects.
In the event that the user can’t find (or doesn’t want to join) a group, It also allows for the creation of a project page, so they can start their own group. The project page contains details of what someone's idea for a project entails.

### What are the expected outcomes?

Provide a platform for recreational users and experienced creatives alike to meet, learn, and build together, fostering communities and connections.

A new version of an app that already exists, but is significantly different. (Reddit, Meetup, GitHub, Facebook groups, etc)
